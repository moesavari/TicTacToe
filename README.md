This project is a simple TicTacToe game where you can play with another person or against the AI.

PvP is simple - X goes first. You guys decide with Rock Paper Scissors who wants to be X.

VS AI has difficulty modes:

Easy - AI makes random choices, sometimes it works out in its favour.

Normal - AI looks at the player's track and sees where the player's icons are. If it finds a winning pattern
          it will block that pattern. Otherwise it will drop a random icon in.
          
Hard - AI uses Minimax algorithm to avoid the worst possible pattern.
